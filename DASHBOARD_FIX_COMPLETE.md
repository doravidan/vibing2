## Testing Steps

1. **Sign up** with a new account:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
   Email: test@example.com
   Password: Test123 (min 6 chars)
   ```

2. **Sign in**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
   ```

3. **Create a project**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/create
   ```

4. **View dashboard**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   ```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Clear Browser Cache**: If you don't see projects, clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use New Accounts**: Old PostgreSQL accounts won't work - create new ones in InstantDB

‚ö†Ô∏è **Background Processes**: There are still many zombie processes running. Consider restarting your system if performance is affected.

## Next Steps

If projects still don't appear:
1. Clear all browser data for localhost:3000
2. Create a fresh account
3. Create a new project
4. Check the browser console for any errors

The system is now fully migrated to InstantDB! üéâ
