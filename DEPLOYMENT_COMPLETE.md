## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy:

### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `quickvibe` (or any name you prefer)
   - Keep it public or private
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push Code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quickvibe.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Connect to Railway**
   - Go to: https://railway.app/project/7ab5f33b-a7d6-491a-9b40-93a99b6300c4
   - Click "+ New Service"
   - Select "GitHub Repo"
   - Choose your `quickvibe` repository
   - Railway will start building automatically!

4. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   - In the same project, click "+ New"
   - Select "Database"
   - Choose "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will automatically connect it

5. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add these variables:

   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
   AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret-here
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXTAUTH_URL=${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}
   ```

   Note: `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set by Railway when you add PostgreSQL

6. **Run Database Migrations**
   - In your service settings, go to "Deployments"
   - Click the three dots on the latest deployment
   - Select "View Logs"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Then run migrations via Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   export RAILWAY_TOKEN=your-railway-token-here
   railway run pnpm prisma migrate deploy
   ```

7. **Generate Domain**
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Under "Networking", click "Generate Domain"
   - Your app will be live at: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Set Railway token
export RAILWAY_TOKEN=2faaf866-137c-473c-a8ca-422878b80a43

# The project is already linked!
# Just add services:

# Add PostgreSQL
railway add --database postgres

# Set environment variables
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
railway variables set AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret-here"
railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"

# Deploy
railway up

# Run migrations
railway run pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# Get your domain
railway domain
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created:

### railway.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm run start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20", "pnpm"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pnpm install"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["pnpm prisma generate", "pnpm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "pnpm run start"
```

## 📊 Monitoring Your Deployment:

- **View Logs:** Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Deployments → View Logs
- **Metrics:** Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Metrics
- **Domains:** Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings → Networking

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Build Failed?
- Check Railway logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify PostgreSQL is connected

### Database Connection Issues?
- Make sure PostgreSQL service is running
- Check DATABASE_URL is automatically set
- Run migrations: `railway run pnpm prisma migrate deploy`

### App Not Loading?
- Check if domain is generated
- Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your Railway domain
- Check deployment logs for errors

---

## 📱 Your App Will Be Live At:

After generating a domain in Railway Dashboard:
```
https://quickvibe-production.up.railway.app
```

(Your actual domain will be different)
