# AWS Deployment Status - Current Issue

## Instance Created Successfully ✅

- **Instance ID**: i-0fe3933bc04811754
- **Public IP**: 34.228.68.149
- **Instance Type**: t2.micro (1GB RAM)
- **Status**: Running but unresponsive

## Problem: Out of Memory

The t2.micro instance (1GB RAM) is running out of memory during the Next.js build process. This is causing:
- SSH connections to timeout
- Instance to become unresponsive
- Build process to hang

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Add Swap Space (Recommended - Free)

SSH into the instance once it recovers and add swap:

```bash
# Wait for instance to recover (may take 5-10 minutes)
# Then SSH in:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vibing2-key-1760354673.pem ec2-user@34.228.68.149

# Add 2GB swap file
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Now try building again
cd /home/ec2-user/vibing2
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

### Option 2: Upgrade to t2.small ($17/month)

t2.small has 2GB RAM which is enough for Next.js builds:

```bash
# Stop instance
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0fe3933bc04811754 --region us-east-1

# Wait for it to stop
aws ec2 wait instance-stopped --instance-ids i-0fe3933bc04811754 --region us-east-1

# Change instance type
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \
    --instance-id i-0fe3933bc04811754 \
    --instance-type t2.small \
    --region us-east-1

# Start instance
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0fe3933bc04811754 --region us-east-1
```

### Option 3: Build Locally, Deploy Binary

Build on your local machine and deploy the built app:

```bash
# On your local machine
cd /Users/I347316/dev/vibing2
pnpm install
pnpm run build

# Create deployment package
tar -czf vibing2-build.tar.gz .next node_modules package.json server.js

# Upload to instance
scp -i ~/.ssh/vibing2-key-1760354673.pem vibing2-build.tar.gz ec2-user@34.228.68.149:/home/ec2-user/

# SSH and extract
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vibing2-key-1760354673.pem ec2-user@34.228.68.149
cd /home/ec2-user/vibing2
tar -xzf ../vibing2-build.tar.gz
```

## Current Status

The instance needs to be:
1. Either given more RAM via swap
2. Upgraded to t2.small
3. Or have the build done locally

Once one of these solutions is applied, the deployment can continue.

## What's Already Done ✅

- Instance created and running
- Security groups configured
- SSH key generated
- Git repository cloned
- User-data script configured Node.js, pnpm, nginx

## What's Needed

- More memory for the build process
- Environment variables configuration
- Service restart

## Deployment Info

All details saved in: `deployment/deployment-info.txt`

```
Instance ID: i-0fe3933bc04811754
Public IP: 34.228.68.149
SSH Key: ~/.ssh/vibing2-key-1760354673.pem
```

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (Add Swap)** - It's free and will work once the instance recovers from the current memory pressure.
