## 🎯 Current Focus

**Next Immediate Action:** Decide whether to proceed with Phase 2 or wait for user requirements

### Recommendations

1. **Option A: Continue to Phase 2**
   - Pros: Build momentum, add core capability
   - Cons: May not be needed yet
   - Time: 4-5 days

2. **Option B: Test Phase 1 thoroughly**
   - Pros: Ensure quality, identify issues
   - Cons: Delays feature development
   - Time: 1 day

3. **Option C: Skip to Phase 3**
   - Pros: Better code quality immediately
   - Cons: No execution environment
   - Time: 3-4 days

**Recommended:** Test Phase 1, then proceed to Phase 2 for full-stack capability.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. Next.js 15 + Turbopack = very fast dev experience
2. Vercel AI SDK makes streaming trivial
3. Clean architecture from the start pays off
4. PFC protocol helped minimize context usage

### Challenges

1. Port 3000 was occupied (auto-resolved to 3001)
2. Had to move files from temp directory (create-next-app limitation)

### Optimizations Applied

1. Used `--turbopack` flag for faster builds
2. Edge runtime for streaming API
3. Progressive enhancement approach
4. Minimal dependencies initially

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Technical Debt

- None yet (fresh codebase)

### Scalability Concerns

- API key management (needs better solution)
- Rate limiting not implemented
- No analytics or monitoring

### Security

- API key in `.env.local` (acceptable for local dev)
- No input sanitization yet (should add in Phase 4)
- CORS not configured (will need for WebContainer)

---

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. Need to test with actual API key
2. Should add more example prompts to landing page
3. Consider adding dark mode
4. May want to add example chat conversations
5. Should implement proper error boundaries
