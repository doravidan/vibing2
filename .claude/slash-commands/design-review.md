## OBJECTIVE

Use the design-review agent to comprehensively review the complete diff above, following these requirements:

### Phase 1: Cultural and Technical Analysis
1. **Identify UI/UX Changes**: Determine which components, pages, or visual elements have been modified
2. **Cultural Sensitivity Check**: Assess any changes for appropriateness in Judaica/religious context
3. **Hebrew/English Integration**: Verify bilingual functionality and RTL layout considerations
4. **E-commerce Impact**: Evaluate impact on shopping flow, product discovery, and conversion

### Phase 2: Live Environment Testing  
1. **Start Development Server**: If not already running, start the development environment
2. **Navigate to Changed Pages**: Use Playwright to visit each affected view
3. **Interactive Testing**: Test user flows, especially cart, checkout, and product browsing
4. **Multi-Viewport Validation**: Test desktop (1440px), tablet (768px), and mobile (375px)
5. **Hebrew Text Rendering**: Verify Hebrew text displays correctly across all viewports
6. **Screenshot Documentation**: Capture evidence of each major view tested

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Evaluation
Follow the systematic 7-phase review process defined in the design-review agent:
- Preparation and cultural sensitivity assessment
- E-commerce & Judaica-specific flow testing  
- Responsiveness & cross-cultural testing
- Visual polish & brand consistency
- Accessibility & internationalization
- E-commerce robustness testing
- Code health, performance, content & security

### Phase 4: Reference Project Standards
Always consult and reference:
- `/context/design-principles.md` - Project-specific design guidelines
- `/context/style-guide.md` - Yodayika brand and styling guidelines
- Existing component patterns in the codebase
- Cultural and religious appropriateness standards

### FINAL DELIVERABLE

Your response must contain ONLY the markdown design review report in the structured format defined by the design-review agent, including:

1. **Design Review Summary** with cultural sensitivity acknowledgment
2. **E-commerce & Cultural Considerations** section
3. **Findings** organized by priority (Blockers, High-Priority, Medium-Priority, Nitpicks)  
4. **Hebrew/RTL Specific Issues** section
5. **Performance & Accessibility Notes** section

Include screenshots as evidence for visual issues and maintain focus on the user experience impact for Judaica customers shopping online.
