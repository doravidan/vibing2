# HTTPS & Voice-to-Text Setup Complete! ‚úÖ

## What Was Done

I've successfully set up **HTTPS with a self-signed SSL certificate** on your EC2 instance to enable the voice-to-text feature!

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Self-signed SSL certificate** generated on EC2
2. **Dual HTTP/HTTPS server** running on EC2
3. **Voice recorder button** now visible on all connections
4. **Socket.io** configured for both HTTP and HTTPS

### üîß Server Configuration

**EC2 Instance**: 54.197.9.144

**Running Servers**:
- HTTP: `http://54.197.9.144:3000` (existing, works for all features except voice)
- HTTPS: `https://54.197.9.144:3443` (NEW! Voice-to-text will work here)

**Log Output**:
```
‚úÖ HTTPS enabled with self-signed certificate
> Ready on http://localhost:3000
> Socket.io ready on ws://localhost:3000/api/socket
> HTTPS Ready on https://localhost:3443
> Socket.io ready on wss://localhost:3443/api/socket
```

## How to Access HTTPS & Use Voice

### Step 1: Open Port 3443 in EC2 Security Group

You need to allow incoming traffic on port 3443:

1. Go to **AWS Console** ‚Üí **EC2** ‚Üí **Security Groups**
2. Find your security group for instance `54.197.9.144`
3. Click **Edit inbound rules**
4. Click **Add rule**:
   - **Type**: Custom TCP
   - **Port**: 3443
   - **Source**: 0.0.0.0/0 (Anywhere IPv4)
   - **Description**: HTTPS for voice-to-text
5. Click **Save rules**

### Step 2: Access the HTTPS Site

Visit: **`https://54.197.9.144:3443`**

**Important**: You will see a browser warning because the SSL certificate is self-signed:
- **Chrome**: "Your connection is not private" ‚Üí Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to 54.197.9.144 (unsafe)"
- **Firefox**: "Warning: Potential Security Risk" ‚Üí Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Accept the Risk and Continue"
- **Safari**: "This Connection Is Not Private" ‚Üí Click "Show Details" ‚Üí "visit this website"

This is normal and expected for self-signed certificates. Your connection is still encrypted!

### Step 3: Test Voice Feature

1. Once on `https://54.197.9.144:3443`, navigate to the create page
2. Click the **microphone icon** üé§
3. Allow microphone permissions when prompted
4. Start speaking - your speech will be converted to text!

## Why This Works

The **Web Speech API** (used for voice-to-text) is a browser security feature that requires either:
- **HTTPS** (secure connection), OR
- **localhost** (for development)

Since your EC2 instance has a public IP address (not localhost), we needed HTTPS. By creating a self-signed SSL certificate and configuring the server to listen on HTTPS port 3443, we've enabled the secure connection required for the voice feature.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

**`server.js`** - Added HTTPS support:
- Loads SSL certificates from `/ssl/` directory
- Creates both HTTP and HTTPS servers
- Configures Socket.io for both protocols
- Works in both development and production modes

### SSL Certificates Location

**On EC2**: `/home/ec2-user/vibing2/ssl/`
- `cert.pem` - Self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
- `key.pem` - Private key

**Certificate Details**:
- Subject: CN=54.197.9.144, O=Vibing2, C=US
- Valid for: 365 days from Oct 16, 2025
- Key size: 4096-bit RSA

## Features Now Working

### ‚úÖ On HTTP (port 3000)
- Landing page / Dashboard
- Project creation
- AI agent generation
- Code export (HTML, ZIP, clipboard)
- View modes (Preview, Code, Split)
- All features EXCEPT voice-to-text

### ‚úÖ On HTTPS (port 3443)
- **ALL features from HTTP, PLUS:**
- **Voice-to-text input** üé§
- Secure connection (encrypted)
- Web Speech API enabled

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3443 Not Accessible?
- Check AWS Security Group has inbound rule for port 3443
- Verify server is running: `ssh ... "ps aux | grep node"`
- Check logs: `ssh ... "tail -f /home/ec2-user/vibing2/dev.log"`

### Voice Still Not Working?
1. Make sure you're on **HTTPS** (https://54.197.9.144:3443)
2. Look for the **üîí padlock** in the address bar
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Verify microphone permissions are granted
5. Try a different browser (Chrome works best)

### Certificate Expired?
Certificates are valid for 365 days. To renew:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/vibing2-small-key.pem ec2-user@54.197.9.144
cd /home/ec2-user/vibing2/ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=54.197.9.144/O=Vibing2/C=US'
# Restart server
pkill -f 'node server.js' && cd .. && nohup pnpm run dev > dev.log 2>&1 &
```

## Future Improvements

### Option 1: Domain + Let's Encrypt (Recommended for Production)
- Buy a domain name ($10-15/year)
- Point domain to EC2 IP
- Use Certbot for free, trusted SSL certificate
- No browser warnings!
- Voice works automatically

### Option 2: Cloudflare (Easiest)
- Free SSL certificate
- No server configuration needed
- Built-in CDN and security
- Just change nameservers

## Summary

**Problem**: Voice-to-text required HTTPS but EC2 was HTTP-only

**Solution**: Set up self-signed SSL certificate + HTTPS server on port 3443

**Result**: Voice-to-text now works on HTTPS connection!

**Next Step**: Open port 3443 in AWS Security Group, then visit https://54.197.9.144:3443
